# Sea battle
![Language (C++)](https://img.shields.io/badge/powered_by-C++-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square) 

A classic sea battle game made in C++ using STL.

## Controls

There are two part of game :
- Placing part : use **WASD** to move ship, **SPACE** to place, **r** to rotate ships
- Battle part : just type filed in form "LN", where L - is letter from A to H, and N - number from
1 to 8.

Project is still in progress, so there are no screen shot, and you can't fully play it.
